My name is mohamed Hsin Bennour, I am currently a student at Tunis Business School,doing my Master's in Business analytics.

Though my undergrad studies were about economics, statistics, and econometrics, I found myself pushing harder and harder to gain knowledge on machine learning and advanced statistics and especially tools of the information: programming languages. 

So here I am trying to build my website from scratch since google doesn't really help you with that. 
Anyways, I hope you find my humble online home comfortable enough for your taste.
